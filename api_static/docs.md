# What we are doing
```bash
The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is responsible.
Universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in the form of computer programs.
- Joseph Weizenbaum, Computer Power and Human Reason

# Computers
Back in the day when personal computers were first hitting the scene you couldn't use one without
some knowledge of how to code.
Nowadays computers are everywhere and most users do not get much further than clicking things with a mouse.
For non-developers this is awesome, could you imagine how bad Apple sales would be if you had to take a college
programming class just to log on to your facebook, even more facebook, ig and the rest wouldn't exist altogether.
For those of us that want to get into that computer and give it commands in code, this means we have to jump through certain hoops.
Enter the terminal, text editors like Atom and other tools like it.

There are even browser based tools that allow us to be able to run our code in the browser, in this tutorial we'll make use
of one of those browser tools and also show you how to run MambaScript on your own computer.
