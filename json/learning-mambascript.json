This keyword allows you to perform administrative tasks on your device. You will be prompted to enter your password when you do this. It's important to note 99% of the time this is your computer password\nand also you won't see the password appear on your screen at all. This is for safety, just type the password and press enter/return.</p>\n<h1 id=\"step5\">Step 5</h1>\n<p>Next you need to download the Atom Text Editor because it is the only editor that currently supports MambaScript,\nsoon we will support Sublime, Neovim and VS Code as well, and any other editor's will be up to the community to support.</p>\n<p>You can download atom by clicking <a href=\"https://atom.io\"><strong>here</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://atom.io\"><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/jzwngsqjogj0q1o/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-31%20at%209.15.27%20PM.png?dl=1\" alt=\"atom\" /></a></p>\n<p>Note: If you are using a mac, make sure to drag and drop Atom into your Applications folder after you install it, if not you  will get weird bugs</p>\n<h1 id=\"step6\">Step 6</h1>\n<p>Once you have opened Atom, you need to install the MambaScript Language package so you can now read MambaScript files.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ryw42jfzau5a1uf/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-31%20at%209.19.26%20PM.png?dl=1\" alt=\"language\" /></p>\n<p>The one with the handsome black man next to it lol, is the one you want to install.</p>\n<h1 id=\"step7\">Step 7</h1>\n<p>Pat yourself on the back your ready to start using mambascript on the machine you just set up.</p>\n<h1 id=\"clickheretogotodocsdocs-1\"><a href=\"/docs\">Click Here To Go To Docs</a></h1>\n<p></center></p>","data":{"title":"Getting Ready to Learn MambaScript","subTitle":"How to setup your device for using mambascript","excerpt":"I want to be the best.
